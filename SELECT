1. Write a query to display each employee's first name, last name, and a calculated column that categorizes their salary into 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low'. Create the salary grade.

SELECT FIRST_NAME, 
       LAST_NAME,
       SALARY,
       CASE 
           WHEN SALARY <5000 THEN 'Low'
           WHEN SALARY BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000 THEN 'Medium'
           WHEN SALARY >10000 THEN 'High' END AS SALARY_GRADE
FROM EMPLOYEES;

2. Write a query to list employees whose salaries are above the average salary of their respective departments. Calculate the average salary per department.
